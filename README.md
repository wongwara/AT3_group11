**Assessment 3 - Group Project**

**The Brief:**

A bank has hired you as their first data scientists. They have been collecting transactional data from their customers for the last 3 years. 

They are not well versed in Data Science nor Machine Learning. Your team has been tasked to explore existing datasets and propose machine learning use cases that will bring value directly  to the business or the end customers.

Each member of your team has to define a business problem from the shared datasets, train relevant Machine Learning algorithms and showcase results achieved. You have to provide at least one use case for each type of the following data mining problem:

* Regression analysis
* Classification analysis
* Unsupervised learning such as clustering, anomaly detection, etc

Here are some examples of potential use cases:

* Helping customers to better budget their finances by predicting their total spending amount for the next month
* Helping Compliance Team to identify fraudulent behavior by predicting if a transaction is a fraud or not
* Helping Sales Team to target customers most likely to have a significant increase in spending in the next 3 months
* Helping Marketing Team to send customized marketing emails to groups of customers presenting similar spending behaviors 
* Helping Customer Support team to reach out to customers with abnormal behaviors from their usual spending patterns

**Submission Requirements:** 

* Final Jupyter Notebooks (1 notebook for each use case/student)

* A final report reflecting on the project, each business uses cases chosen, approaches taken, experiments performed and their outcome and the benefits and risks for the customers or business units. The report should not exceed 5000 words. Use the steps defined by the CRISP-DM methodology for the sections of your report.

**All assignments need to be submitted before the due date on Canvas. Penalties will be applied for late submission.**

**Assessment Criteria:**

* Soundness of justification for selected technique
* Quality of code and visualisations
* Accuracy of results and evidence supporting claims
* Breadth of evidence of collaborative work (e.g. meeting minutes, details of contributions etc) 
* Criticality and specificity in evaluating assumptions and potential ethical issues 
* Appropriateness of communication style to audience
