# AT3_group11

There are 4 main objectives for our project:
1. Experiment A: Better decision making- Client Financial management: Help clients organise their budget by predicting their spending for the next month. This will help improve financial stability and overall pleasure.
2. Experiment B: Prevention of fraud - Help the compliance team identify and stop fraudulent behaviour. This will protect our financial stability and keep our client's faith intact.
3. Experiment C: Improved customer experience - Assist the sales and marketing teams in maximising their participation and enjoyment for clients likely to raise their expenditure in the next three months. By focusing our marketing strategies and offers on these potential high-value clients.
4. Experiment D: Better risk management - Discover abnormal spending patterns: Help us reach out to consumers proactively, providing customised advice and assistance in resolving any potential problems or financial challenges they may face.
